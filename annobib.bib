  annotate  = {Spectral clustering first involves the establishment of a graph
and definition of a pairwise vertex similarity metric.  A graph type
($\epsilon$-neighborhood, $k$-nearest and mutual $k$-nearest neighborhood,
fully-connected) must be specified.  The type of Laplacian (normalized
random-walk, normalized symmetric, or unnormalized) should be chosen, and the
Laplacian matrix computed.  A matrix should be created with columns consisting
of the $k$ smallest eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix.  The row vectors of
this new matrix should be partitioned into $k$ classes, via $k$-means
clustering.  If the $i$th row vector was assigned to the $j$th cluster, then the
$i$th vertex in the training set is assigned to some $j$th cluster of vertices.

Temporal lobe epilepsy is characterized by newly-presented hypometabolic
features in some region of the brain. Spectral clustering could be applied to
the diagnostic problem by identifying the patient as having a specific class of
epilepsy (bilateral, \ac{ltle}, \ac{rtle}, unlateralized) based on which ROI has
experienced the hypometabolism.

Toward the \ac{fmri}/\ac{eeg} fusion problem: after transforming \ac{eeg}
spectral bands onto \ac{fmri} voxel space, different spectral bands (either single or
multiple bands at a time) could be clustered with \ac{fmri} signal. In this
scheme the spectral band data and \ac{fmri} data would be vertices on a graph
that is weighted based on temporal proximity, similarity in signal strength, or
another factor.}

   placed oil the electrophysiological and neuroanatomical basis of the
   method, on the localization properties of the method, and oil the
   validation of the method in real experimental human data. Papers that
   criticize LORETA are briefly discussed. LORETA publications in the
   1994-1997 period based localization inference on images of raw electric
   neuronal activity. In 1998, a series of papers appeared that based
   localization inference on the statistical parametric mapping methodology
   applied to high-time resolution LORETA images. Starting in 1999,
   quantitative neuroanatomy was added to the methodology based oil the
   digitized Talairach atlas provided by the Brain Imaging Centre, Montreal
   Neurological Institute. The combination of these methodological
   developments has placed LORETA at a level that compares favorably to the
   more classical functional imaging methods, such as PET and \ac{fmri}. (C)

  annotate={This chapter presents a discussion of various techniques for
integrating \ac{eeg} and \ac{fmri} information. The goal is to formulate an accurate
representation of brain activity with the spatial density of \ac{fmri} and temporal
density of \ac{eeg}. Asymmetrical approaches use one form of data as a predictor for
details of the other form, for example \ac{eeg} and its temporal density (resp. \ac{fmri}
and its spatial density) as a predictor for temporal details of \ac{fmri} (resp.
spatial details of \ac{eeg}). These models assume a strong level of truth to the
predictor data. Symmetrical approaches, information fusion, equally weight the
different types of data and attempt to identify complementary features. The goal
of these techniques is to invert the data, taking \ac{eeg} (resp. \ac{fmri}) from
[scalp-measured voltage] (resp. \ac{bold} signal) to underlying neural activity.}

SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION},

  annotate={Principal component analysis provides a method for reducing the
dimensionality of data--or more importantly, reducing redundancy and noise. It
is derived from the assumption that noise and redundant data will typically
exhibit low variance, whereas the principal components will exhibit higher
variance. It is proven that given a few additional assumptions, the principal
components can be obtained from the original data by applying a linear
transformation to the original data. This linear transform is obtained from the
assumption that we wish to diagonalize the covariance matrix--and therefore
reduce the redundancy of the data.}

annotate = {Varying the duration of an external stimulus application results in
a modulation of $\gamma$-\ac{ersp} power that is similar to modulation of the \ac{bold}
response in certain regions of the brain (peri-calcarine cortex, fusiform gyrus,
and lateral-temporal-occipital cortex). Lower-frequency \ac{ersp} power is not
modulated to the same extent as are the $\gamma$-\ac{ersp} power and the \ac{bold} signal.
This observation suggests that the change in \ac{bold} signal could be indicative of
a corresponding change in $\gamma$-\ac{ersp} power.

The methods used (wavelet decomposition with a sliding window over time) are
relatively novel and may have yielded better temporal resolution than previous
work. This improvement in resolution may have allowed for detection of more
minute, temporary changes than was possible in earlier studies. Further, the
inclusion of frequencies larger than 45 Hz into the $\gamma$-band allows for
increased sensitivity to high-frequency signals.

the \ac{ica} were deconvolved together to estimate an \ac{irf}
for component pairs of each \ac{fmri} and \ac{eeg} components. This method treats the
\ac{fmri} component time-course as the result of the convolution of the \ac{eeg}
component time-course and the \ac{irf}. The deviations in the \ac{irf} are indicative of
\ac{eeg} responses being associated with subsequent \ac{fmri} \ac{bold} signal. These
results were analyzed for similarities in associations in each of the different
frequencies, observing positive associations between \ac{eeg} and \ac{fmri} in lower
and upper frequencies and negative associations in various alpha sources.}
